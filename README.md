## Getting Started
These instructions can be used to run the project locally for development and testing. 
1. Open your terminal and go to the root of the project
2. Run 'npm install' - This downloads the dependencies that are needed to properly run the website
3. Run 'npm start' - This starts the Express server, and the React app at the same time
